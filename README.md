# Riddle Game
Practical Python Milestone project by Maciej Pawelek
# Project guidelines:
# CREATE A 'RIDDLE-ME-THIS' GUESSING GAME
* Build a web application game that asks players to guess the answer to a pictorial or text-based riddle.
* The player is presented with an image or text that contains the riddle. Players enter their answer into a textarea and submit their answer using a form.
* If a player guesses correctly, they are redirected to the next riddle.
* If a player guesses incorrectly, their incorrect guess is stored and printed below the riddle. The textarea is cleared so they can guess again.
* Multiple players can play an instance of the game at the same time. Users are identified by a unique username.
* Create a leaderboard that ranks top scores for all users.
